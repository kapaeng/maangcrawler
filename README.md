I am interested in Jane Street because of the firm’s reputation for technical rigor and its unique culture around programming languages and systems. My career spans from designing OOEL at TradeStation (a compiled-to-assembly runtime used by traders) to leading large-scale build system migrations at Airbnb. Most recently, I joined Cottage Eats as a founding engineer, where I built the initial product and infrastructure from scratch. Jane Street is one of the few places where my background in compilers, infrastructure, and performance engineering aligns directly with the core of the business.

I’ve known about Jane Street for many years.

I’m currently a founding engineer at Cottage Eats, where I built the MVP and core infrastructure. I’m now looking for a larger-scale technical environment where I can apply my experience in compilers, infrastructure, and performance systems to have broader impact.
